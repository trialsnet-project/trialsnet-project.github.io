  title: Objective
title: Use Case 5 - Control Room in Metaverse
--- 
This use case aims to demonstrate the performance, relevance and impact of 5G and B5G-enabled technologies, such as metaverse, XR, digital twinning and IoT solutions, in the context of a novel remote, environment-tailored, inter-agency XR training and real-time visualization of movement patterns/behavioral anomalies, resulting in improved management of large events (and potential situations of panic) through improved decision making and reduced intervention times. The control room will be designed to ensure full scalability in terms of environments that can be uploaded, avatars that can be created, real-time data that can be integrated (and visualized in the form of analytics) as well as domains of application that can be covered, starting with the events area of Valentino Park and a baseline training scenario for improved mission planning, protocol testing and real-time, in-platform communications. As a result, the Control Room in Metaverse aims to deploy sensors and cameras for counting people while re-creating by means of LIDAR scanning and 3D rendering the digital twin of Valentino Park (events area) which will be populated with engaging digital content. Thus, it enables local emergency responders (inter alia, police, civil protection, 112, 118 and firefighters) to undertake remote XR training and be able to visualize real-time movement patterns for enhanced situational awareness. The control room will enable emergency responders to undertake immersive remote, environment-tailored, inter-agency XR training for mission planning, intervention protocol testing, real-time communications exchange, and mission debriefing. Furthermore, it will enable access to real-time analytics from sensors and cameras-detected data on movement patterns and behavioral anomalies. Analytics from in-loco sensors and cameras will be displayed directly in the metaverse application.
