  title: Objective
title: Use Case 13 - Extended XR museum experience (Turin)
---

The goal of this use case is to create a modular metaverse platform for visiting museums in Turin through portable devices. The use case will entail creating new interactive experiences in 	collabora-tion with museums and will exploit two different metaverse platforms. Users will be able to 	visit collec-tions with friends and family in remote locations and/or in presence in selected locations. A captivating narrative will also be developed to make the experience more engaging, interactive, and informative by reusing part of the results of the previous project 5G-TOURS.
