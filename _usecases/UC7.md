title: Use Case 7 - Remote Proctoring
---

This use case aims to support remote proctoring activities in the field of interventional cardiology, offering innovative solutions based on smart tools for telepresence in the surgical field to connect expert proctors and remote hospitals. UC7 will be deployed by connecting two sites at a geographical distance, via a dedicated Virtual Private Network (VPN), and equipping with tailored 5G coverage the site where the proctor is located. This allows increasing the number of remote hospitals that can leverage the support of remote experts and improve the entire eHealth workflow of interventional cardiology.
