  title: Objective
title: Use Case 2 - Proactive Public Infrastructure Assets Management
---
This use case involves collecting data from various sources such as security cameras, drones, municipal vehicles, and weather information. The data will be processed using AI and Deep Learning (DL) mechanisms to provide relevant information about the condition of public infrastructure assets. Remotely controlled cobots will also be used to assist in necessary maintenance activities. The solution will utilize data from various sources, such as municipal vehicles, weather information, security cameras drones and robots, to assess the structural health of buildings, pavements, and roads. The data collected will allow for more efficient and effective proactive management of public infrastructure assets, leading to cost savings and improved operations and services. The use of Augmented Reality (AR) will allow construction workers to have an on-site view of buildings or other assets blueprints and receive live bidirectional communications with remote experts who can provide assistance and video instructions. Remotely controlled or unmanned vehicles will be used to reduce risk and accelerate the building process. AI techniques, such as Neural Networks (NN) and DL, will be used to assess the state of public infrastructure assets, produce alerts and suggestions for city authorities, improve workersâ€™ safety, and schedule predictive maintenance. Digital Twins of public construction sites will be used to validate complicated technical plans without wasting physical resources. These Digital Twins will be accessed by VR headsets, allowing real-time monitoring of the construction site. The utilization of B5G can enable faster and more reliable data transfer, which is critical for real-time monitoring and analysis of public infrastructure assets. This can lead to faster response times and improved decision-making by city authorities.

This use case will be implemented in two areas within the Greek Cluster: the Athens International Airport and public infrastructure provided by DAEM in the Municipality of Athens.
