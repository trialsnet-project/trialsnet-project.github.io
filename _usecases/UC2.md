title: Use Case 2 - Proactive Public Infrastructure Assets Management
---
This use case offers a solution to improve the management and maintenance of infrastructure assets in Athens International Airport and DAEM's public infrastructure in Athens. The solution utilizes advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms and unmanned vehicles to enhance the effectiveness of data collection and assessment of infrastructure assets. AI techniques will analyze data from multiple sources to evaluate infrastructure assets, generate alerts and recommendations for maintenance tasks, improve worker safety, while unmanned vehicles will assist with the necessary maintenance operations. Augmented Reality (AR) will be used to provide on-site views of assets' blueprints and live communications with remote experts. In addition, Digital Twins (DT) of public construction sites will be created, allowing for validation of technical plans and real-time monitoring.
