  text: Provide innovative solutions developed by the project for the most effective coordination operation of first  responders (medical personnel, police, rescuers, etc.) in the context of i) triage and coordination of resources at the scene of MCI due to incidents such as earthquakes, fires, building collapses, and ii) emergency evacuation in a large, crowded venue, such as in the case of a sports event.

  title: Objective
title: UC6 - Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) and Emergency Rescue in Populated Area
---
The UC6 aims to offer cutting-edge technological solutions created by TrialsNet for the most effective coordination for first-case responders in the context of i) triage and coordination of resources at the scene of mass casualty incidents, which could be building collapses, earthquakes, fires, or other large-scale emergencies, and ii) an emergency evacuation in the context of a crowded sporting or cultural event. This use case has the ambition to demonstrate the viability of a coordinated response in a densely populated area as well as more effective and digitally traceable pre-hospital care by first responders in the event of MCI. Through this use case, cutting edge (and 5G/B5G/6G) technologies will be shown off in a large-scale field exercise for more effective first responder communication, quicker and more efficient triage, and pre-hospital treatment, and they will be compared to the baseline approach using conventional approaches. The evacuation part of the use case will be implemented both in Athens and in Spain with the use of a different Fifth generation of mobile communications (5G) infrastructures.

### Trial

On March 16th, 2025, during a basketball game at the [Movistar Arena](https://www.movistararena.com.ar/), the solution was tested in an operational environment, involving real users and gathering their user experience. The venue was hosting more than 10.000 people, among spectators and workers. In such a setting an efficient use of rescue resources is key, in the case of an emergency. To achieve this goal, the UC6 solution helps resource management and allocation by providing semi-automated triaging of patients, automated monitoring of their vital signs and location, and suggesting the best evacuation path to victims.

The trial execution was possible thanks to the collaboration between UC3M (managing the trial), ERC (providing the infrastructure), TID (allowing the bandwidth usage), and Movistar Arena (giving access to the venue and helping with the operative logistics). The trial was executed in the context of a [trial event](https://www.5tonic.org/5tonic-and-ericsson-test-5g-sa-on-millimetre-waves-at-movistar-arena/), including trialing of [UC1 - Smart Crowd Monitoring](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC1/) and [UC10 - Immersive fan engagement](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC10/), lasting the whole day and including two different major basketball games in the same venue, and involving other project partners (PROS and YBVR), as well as external partners and a lot of end-users, including [Movistar Estudiantes](https://www.movistarestudiantes.com/), [5Tonic](https://www.5tonic.org/), and more.

All the recorded measurements are currently under analysis. The results of such analysis will be used to enhance the solution and its implementation for the Athen's trial.
