  text: Provide innovative solutions developed by the project for the most effective coordination operation of first  responders (medical personnel, police, rescuers, etc.) in the context of i) triage and coordination of resources at the scene of MCI due to incidents such as earthquakes, fires, building collapses, and ii) emergency evacuation in a large, crowded venue, such as in the case of a sports event.

  title: Objective
title: Use Case 6 - Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) and Emergency Rescue in Populated Area
---
The Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) provides strategies for the basic approach to MCI response procedures, regardless of the type of threat. Safety resources should be built to handle MCI scenarios. Local fire/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Law Enforcement (LE) must have common tactics, communication capabilities, and terminology to have seamless, effective operations. The UC6 has the ambition to demonstrate the viability of a coordinated response in a densely populated area as well as more effective and digitally traceable pre-hospital care by first responders in the event of MCI. Through this use case, cutting-edge (and 5G/B5G) technologies will be shown off in a large-scale field exercise for more effective first responder communication, quicker and more efficient triage, and pre-hospital treatment, and they will be compared to the baseline approach using conventional approaches. Triage is of utmost importance in disasters and MCI, as it refers to contingency planning, the actions to be taken and the guidelines to be followed for the effective management of emergencies. This use case aims to provide more efficient and digitally traceable triage procedures and pre-hospital treatment by first responders in case of MCI, as well as showcase the feasibility of a coordinated response in a densely crowded location during which the collected data will be utilized to derive insights on for emergency crews to provide an optimal evacuation plan. This plan will include, with priority, optimal routes to the intervention targets (victims of the disasters), considering any obstacles or inaccessible sections that have been previously identified. Through this use case, innovative (also 6G-enabled) technologies will be demonstrated in a large-scale field exercise for more efficient communication between first responders and faster and more effective triage and pre-hospital treatment, and they will be compared to the baseline approach using traditional approaches/procedures. Initially various data from the field are acquired via available data sources (e.g., video streaming or image capturing from cameras on robots or drones). These data are analyzed to provide insights to first responders on the situation in the field (estimated number of victims, support for primary triaging, estimated location of victims, initial estimation on optimal evacuation routes). Information is displayed to first responders via an appropriate dashboard, while suitable XR applications will also be provided (especially for the evacuation case). For the MCI part, once responders have arrived in the field and have come in contact with victims, they can equip victims with wearable devices to collect vital signs. This information will be used, along with the assessment from the first responders, for the secondary triaging and the continuous monitoring of the health status of victims. Data from the scene and health data are transmitted and displayed continuously to remote first responders and medical experts via the dashboard (displaying the appropriate type of information to each user category). The dashboard is implemented as a Web-based User Interface (UI) and thus, is accessible through mobile devices as well as laptops, desktops, and tablets.  In the event of observed abnormalities either in the environment of the incident or in the vital sign values collected, notifications are sent to first responders or medical experts accordingly (remote and in the field) and alarms are raised to trigger the necessary actions e.g., update the triaging assessment or update of the evacuation routes. Notifications/alarms are also raised in case something is not yet abnormal, but the data analysis of recorded values show a trend towards a potential problematic situation (e.g., increasing blood pressure which has not yet reached a certain threshold, but may still be worrying). For the MCI case, all data accompanies a victim from the field to the hospital, at which point the system can provide doctors with insights for the final triaging and on the best hospital treatment. In the evacuation scenario, an XR application will also be provided for evacuees.

This use case will be deployed both in Athens and in Madrid.
