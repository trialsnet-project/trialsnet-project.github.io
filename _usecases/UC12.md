title: Use Case 12 - City Parks in Metaverse
---

This use case develops around the social metaverse concept, centred on the idea of creating a virtual world where people can interact with each other, form social connections and participate in a variety of activities. It will take place in the Borgo Medievale, one of the main attractions of the Valentino Park of Turin, reproducing a village of ancient Piedmont. During its closure for renovation from 2024 to 2026, the use case intends offering, as alternative to the tourists arriving to the gate of the Borgo, a virtual visit enriched with a layer for gaming along with the possibility for multiple persons to join the visit with their avatars.
