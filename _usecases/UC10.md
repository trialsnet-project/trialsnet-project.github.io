Pre-trials at 5TONIC lab included NR-DC setup and FWA trials focused on 180°/360° camera validation and streaming protocols. The final trial took place during a basketball match at Movistar Arena with 40 participants, combining In-Venue and remote viewing via immersive cameras and a mobile app. This event provided a realistic high-pressure environment to validate system performance, capturing high-bandwidth video streams over 5G and distributing them for VR and mobile streaming. All trials met their defined KPI thresholds, validating the performance of each CPE unit under field conditions. Notably, Service Availability consistently achieved 100%. The aggregated results confirm system reliability, with KPIs indicating robust performance across the network. In-Venue scenario met targets for both downlink and uplink, as well as At-Home scenario. Aggregated field trials results indicated robust network performance. As for KVIs, the evaluation of User Experience and Acceptance for both mobile streaming and VR demonstrated strong, positive correlations with perceived Ease of use, Enjoyment, and Usefulness. Mobile streaming achieved a slightly higher overall User Experience score (82%) compared to VR (80%), while also showing a marginally stronger acceptance rate. Both technologies confirmed their appeal to early adopters. Mobile streaming users were physically present inside the stadium, experiencing the atmosphere and crowd engagement, which enhanced their sense of immersion. VR also achieved strong immersion via 360º view and interactive features.
