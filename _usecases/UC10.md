title: Use Case 10 - Immersive fan engagement
---
This use case aims at increasing the engagement of people who are fans of sport, e.g., during a football match. Two applications will be developed: the first one for home use, taking the spectator to the front row of the match with Virtual Reality (VR) and immersive video on smartphones; the second one live in the stadium, bringing the action to the fan regardless of its seat (which often offers partial or limited view of the playing field and the players). With a low latency multiscreen application, the fans can follow all the details of the match on their tablet or smartphone. For both applications, some preliminary solutions have been identified for the data flow transmission along with the suitable equipment (cameras, server, VR, and smartphones). While the location of the trial has not been selected yet, its planning has been described in some detail.
