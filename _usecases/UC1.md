  text: Ensure security and safety of people at highly busy areas.
  title: Objective
title: Use Case 1 - Smart Crowd Monitoring
---
This use case is oriented to deploy several technology solutions that enable to ensure the security and safety of people at highly busy areas whether they are concentrated in one area or moving from one area to another. Highly crowded public sites such as concerts or sports facilities pose a challenge for the security companies operating on site. An important feature of the protection of public places is achieving the right balance between effective protection and people’s individual and collective fundamental rights. At the same time, the primary goal of event security is not to respond to threats, but to prevent them from occurring. Proper security management in events requires a holistic and technologically advanced approach called “hybrid security model”, and based on three fundamental pillars: people, technology, and data. Regarding the second pillar, the combination of AI, robotics, Virtual Reality (VR) and other technologies help to enhance the prevention capacity of the security companies, however, it also poses several challenges in terms of communications capabilities and cybersecurity risks. B5G (towards 6G) technology is an ideal option for this scenario as it provides high speed of data traffic and ultra-low latency ensuring that commands and orders sent to robots can be received almost instantly, which is critical to ensure that robots respond in real-time. Additionally, B5G (towards 6G) technology can handle a large volume of data, ensuring fast and reliable communication.  In this context, surveillance cameras and LIDARs together with artificial vision algorithms will be applied to support crowd monitoring, detection of suspicious behaviour, tracking of suspects, deterrence and evidence collection. Fixed and robot-based cameras will be installed indoor and will send video streams to the cloud, where different AI algorithms will help to detect risky situations. LIDARs will intead installed outdoor, and their data will be processed by cloud-based software of spatial intelligence, enabling people crowd monitoring and tracking.

UC1 will be deployed in the Madrid (Spain) site in a place hosting sportive competitions and/or spectacles. It will also be deployed in Iasi (Romania), where the two regions of interest to be covered are the square in front of the Palace of Culture and the pedestrian zone between the City Hall and the intersection with a major street situated nearby.
