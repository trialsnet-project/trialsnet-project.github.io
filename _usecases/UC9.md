  title: Objective
title: Use Case 9 - Adaptive Control of Hannes Prosthetic Device
---
This use case will focus on designing advanced control capabilities for prostheses using Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and deployment on the Hannes arm. The main aim of UC9 is to improve the user experience, leveraging radio 5G connectivity to provide sufficient computing power to the prosthesis to deploy AI methods with high reliability and minimal latency.
