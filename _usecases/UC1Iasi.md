  title: Objective
title: Use Case 1 - Smart Crowd Monitoring (Iasi)
---
This use case will be carried out in large public area in Iasi, for the Romanian cluster. The use case will focus on the use of B5G/6G applications to enable situation awareness to key end-users in the City of Iasi, by bringing disparate data streams into a common operational picture for real-time data-driven insights and actionable intelligence. The new platform will ingest available data from arrays of sensors and cameras deployed through the city, communicating over reliable B5G and Wi-Fi networks and output insights and actionable intelligence on public safety monitoring system. The use case will focus on outdoor public events by managing people counting, density, and dynamics of large numbers of persons (flow directions, spread, speed) and detecting special situations during normal traffic scenarios (e.g., presence of various objects such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc. in restricted access areas).
