In this use case an AR application developed on the 5G-TOURS project will be expanded to cover other subjects and areas of interest, such as the Acropolis, the historical triangle of Athens city, and the Corinth canal. This will allow visitors to explore and learn about more exhibits and sightseeing areas. In addition, the possibility of upgrading the capabilities of the application to include VR technology will be explored.
