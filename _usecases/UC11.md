  title: Objective
title: UC11 - Service Robots for Enhanced Passengers' Experience
---
Service Robots for Enhanced Passengers&#39; Experience use case, led by WINGS ICT Solutions (WINGS) and deployed at Athens International Airport (AIA), aims to establish a 5G/B5G-connected airport ecosystem by leveraging AI and real-time data from cameras to streamline passenger flows, minimize waiting times, and support Terminal Operations Supervisors in managing congestion and optimizing check-in counter usage. Intelligent service robots are deployed to assist passengers and enhance their travel experience by offering guidance to boarding gates, thus contributing to more efficient and responsive airport operations.

## Trial

On April 10, 2025, a real-world trial was conducted at Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos, specifically at Entrance 1 in the Arrivals area—a high-traffic zone with a continuous flow of passengers entering the terminal. This location was ideal for evaluating the performance of intelligent service robots under real-world conditions. During the trial, a humanoid robot autonomously navigated the area, offering assistance to passengers while seamlessly communicating with Terminal Operations Supervisors. The primary objective was to demonstrate the robot’s ability to operate autonomously and provide real-time assistance in a dynamic environment, leveraging data from eight thermal cameras installed in the check-in and security areas, monitoring passenger movement, and AI-based intelligence for people flow calculation and identification of congestion points. Using B5G connectivity, the robot maintained low-latency communication, high-precision localization, and real-time coordination with airport staff, enabling effective congestion management and an enhanced passenger experience.
