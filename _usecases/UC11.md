title: UC11 - Service Robots for Enhanced Passengers' Experience
---
This use case aims at improving passengersâ€™ comfort at Athens International Airport, particularly during congested situations. With the use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms, the passenger flow would become smoother by reducing waiting times and queues, which frequently form in different areas of the airport, such as for baggage drop-off and reclaim, security screening, passport control areas. A solution will be developed to aggregate and analyse the passenger data (e.g., user profile, location, flight details, e-ticket, etc.). These will be collected from various applications, based on which AI-enabled robots will assist/inform/entertain passengers during their permanence at the airport. Various sensors will be installed in different areas of the airport, also to detect critical situations and promptly alert the terminal operator supervisor (TOS).
