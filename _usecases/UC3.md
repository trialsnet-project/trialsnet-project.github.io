  title: Objective
title: Use Case 3 - Autonomous APRON
---
This use case demonstrates how autonomous and smart systems can perform ground handling operations at the airport APRON, such as passenger handling, fueling, and baggage handling, using unmanned vehicles and collaborative robots. The development of Digital Twins will enable real-time monitoring and remote control of vehicles, ensuring safer and more efficient operations. AI techniques will be used to analyze data from sensors and cameras, generating alerts and suggestions for improving operations. The integration of a Network Monitoring System (NMS) will enable continuous monitoring and automated mitigation of network anomalies.
