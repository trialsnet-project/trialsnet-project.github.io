  title: Objective
title: Use Case 3 - Autonomous APRON
---
The use case focuses on showcasing how autonomous and smart systems can perform typical ground handling operations at the APRON such as passenger handling, in-flight catering, aircraft fueling, potable water & aircraft toilet servicing, baggage and cargo handling, and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) prevention. This will be achieved using remotely controlled or unmanned vehicles, such as collaborative robots. The Digital Twins of the APRON will be accessed by VR headsets, enabling a real-time depiction of the physical world inside the virtual one. Digital Twins have a significant impact in optimizing the operations of the staff supervising APRON, ensuring safer and incident-free operations. Operators can intervene remotely and take control of vehicles in critical situations. Data will be collected from vehicles in the airport APRON and robots using a variety of sensors, including LIDAR and GPS, as well as images and videos from security cameras. Advanced AI techniques will be employed to analyze the data, identify patterns, and make accurate predictions, allowing for continuous monitoring and analysis of airport operations. Based on these analysis, alerts and suggestions will be generated to improve operations and enhance overall airport efficiency. The integration of a distributed monitoring system will enable the continuous monitoring of unmanned vehicles, collaborative robots, and relevant resources. This system can collect data across the Edge and far Edge resources, and traffic profiling will be conducted to detect network anomalies and predict/prevent failures and security breaches. Automated mitigation procedures will be applied to address any issues that arise. The utilization of 5G technology is crucial to this use case, as it enables low-latency, high-speed communication necessary for real-time monitoring and control of unmanned vehicles and resources. This in turn leads to more efficient and safer airport operations, facilitated by the advanced technologies mentioned above. The high bandwidth and low latency of 5G technology enables faster and more reliable data transfer, resulting in more accurate predictions, better decision-making, and overall improvements in airport operations.
