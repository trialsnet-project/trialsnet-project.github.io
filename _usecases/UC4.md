  title: Objective
title: UC4 - Smart Traffic Management
--- 
This use case will be piloted in the Podu Ro»ô Intersection Area (Iasi city, Romanian Cluster) with a focus on traffic comfort and safety functions. From a comfort perspective, the traffic flow will be monitored to create predictive models and suggest intersection rules adaptation to reduce congestion. Safety will be increased especially by protecting the Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) by creating a digital traffic model, capable of identifying hazardous traffic situations. Based on the same infrastructure of UC1 Iasi, the new platform will ingest available data from arrays of sensors and cameras deployed throughout the city, communicating over reliable B5G and Wi-Fi networks and output insights and actionable intelligence on traffic monitoring system.
