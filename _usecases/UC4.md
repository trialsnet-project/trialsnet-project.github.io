  text: Provide methods to improve traffic management in crowded intersections, detecting and preventing dangerous situations.
  title: Objective
title: Use Case 4 - Smart Traffic Management
--- 
The use case explores the usage and applications of B5G (towards 6G) networks as essential building blocks of Smart Cities and provides key advantages in public safety and security, environmental monitoring, and intelligent traffic monitoring. The use case will provide methods to improve traffic management in a very crowded intersection and to detect and prevent potentially dangerous situations. This solution involves the design, development, and deployment of the envisioned tools that will demonstrate the effectiveness of intelligent traffic management and successfully support the B5G/6G applications in large-scale environments by enabling a tight interaction between humans and the surrounding environments, through the usage of IoT Sensors, Computer Vision and Cameras, within a robust, Zero-Touch Management capability of Edge resources, as well as the large-scale deployment of B5G (towards 6G) networks to support the use case, provided the installation, configuration, and operation of state-of-the-art network components, to cover the areas in which the use case is to be demonstrated. The Platform will ingest available data from arrays of Sensors and Cameras deployed through the city, communicating over reliable B5G and Wi-Fi networks and outputting insights and actionable intelligence on Traffic Monitoring. This use case will focus on traffic comfort and safety functions. From a comfort perspective, the traffic flow will be monitored to create predictive models and suggest intersection rules adaptation to reduce congestion. Safety will be increased especially by protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) by creating a traffic digital model, capable of identifying hazardous traffic situations. In addition to a real-time dynamic mobility digital model, an air quality heat map will be created by collecting data from the IoT sensors for Environmental Monitoring. Deploying a large number of sensors and cameras increases the need for flexibility addressed by unwiring them and the need of high throughput due to the high-resolution video streams.  The safety critical applications impose stringent reliability and latency requirements.  The utilization of B5G can enable faster and reliable data transfer at higher rates, which is critical for real-time traffic monitoring for comfort and safety functions.
