Nextworks’ research and development aims at identifying cutting edge innovative technologies and application scenarios to be turned into company products and knowledge services for the ICT market. In TrialsNet, Nextworks is contributing to build the Italian site infrastructure, bringing its expertise on 5G/6G networks and edge/cloud computing. Nextworks is also active as application developer for TrialsNet use cases, with network monitoring and security solutions in Public Infrastructure Assets Management scenarios and an advanced IoT platform for the Control Room in the Metaverse. Here Nextworks proposes its “digital living” platform Symphony, a service-oriented middleware integrating several functional subsystems into a unified IP-based and fully distributed platform.
