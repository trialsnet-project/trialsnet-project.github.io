Ericsson was established in Spain in 1922 and opened its first factory in Spain in Getafe (Madrid) in 1924. In 1926, Ericsson made its first contribution to the Spanish telephone network with the installation of a central AGF exchange in San Sebastian. Until the late 1960s, Ericsson had a presence in areas such as telex and strategic networks for the military, and in 1969, Ericsson was chosen by Telefonica as a supplier of transmission equipment. Since that time Ericsson opened a factory in Leganés (Madrid) in 1974 with significant contribution with the installation of the first digital switching center in the central AXE Telefonica de Atocha in 1980. Many transformations happened in Spain from that time and is perfectly illustrated in the evolution of the workforce, which remained stable at an average of 3,300 employees, but experienced a substantial change in its composition. In 1990, approximately 70% of the workforce was composed of blue-collar workers, but by the end of the decade, they only accounted for 10% of the workforce. During the same period, the average age of employees dropped by 10 years to the age of 35.
