The Automated Tele-operated Sustainable (ATOS) Driving project explores the integration of teleoperation within Beyond 5G (B5G) and upcoming 6G network frameworks. This integration is designed to support dynamic network conditions and meet stringent teleoperation requirements. By exposing network functions through open APIs, teleoperation services can achieve real-time network performance adaptation, ensuring the reliability and efficiency needed for remote operations.
