title: Automated Tele-Operated Sustainable (ATOS) driving
---
The sub-project’s trial in the Netherlands validated remote truck operation over a B5G network under realistic conditions. Performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and packet loss supported stable control and responsive feedback for the tele-operator, with service reliability remaining high. The results show that teleoperation depends on low-latency, reliable communications with dynamic resource management. For 6G, further latency reduction, ultra-reliability, and AI-driven network slicing will be key to supporting large-scale, safety-critical remote operations.
