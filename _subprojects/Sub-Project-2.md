5GS3 aims to build on top of the provisions of the TrailsNet infrastructure elements to validate a reference implementation of an airport surveillance and patrolling 5G-enabled application that is based on the collaboration of electric robots over an experimental private 5G network at the location of security and safety events, which may result in operational halts and threats to the safety of the aviation industry itself.
