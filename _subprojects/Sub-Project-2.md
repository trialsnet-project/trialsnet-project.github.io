This sub-project at AIA validated autonomous robotic patrols with AI-driven analytics over 5G/B5G networks. Latency was very low, detection accuracy remained high, and service availability was 100%. The system successfully demonstrated anomaly detection, autonomous navigation, and collaborative responses, confirming reliable real-time operation and centralized monitoring. Minor deviations in network throughput did not affect operational performance. Results show that autonomous surveillance can be effectively supported over 5G, but large-scale deployments will require 6G capabilities such as ultra-low latency, extreme reliability, and AI-driven dynamic resource allocation for mission-critical and immersive applications.
