title: MILESTONE - A REAL-TIME AI-ENABLED WORKER SAFETY PRESERVATION SYSTEM
---
The trial in Technopolis (City of Athens) showed that 5G-enabled video monitoring with AI PPE detection effectively improves worker safety. Thirty-two participants were monitored, and the system successfully detected safety violations in real time. Network and AI performance met targets, confirming reliable and responsive operation. The trial highlights the importance of low-latency, high-throughput connectivity and edge-cloud processing for real-time safety monitoring. For 6G, sub-10 ms latency, pervasive coverage, and dynamic edge intelligence will be essential for scalable deployment in public infrastructure environments.
