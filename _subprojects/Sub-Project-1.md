The aim is progressing towards enabling and accelerating tramways to operate as autonomous systems supporting LoA2, backed with technologies to increase the situational awareness of trams. The large-scale trials undertaken in this project aim to assess the 5G network's performance from both communication and positioning perspectives, evaluating its capability to support and enable the future autonomous tram. Moreover, the coexistence of critical and non-critical applications for the autonomous tram will be evaluated, deriving resource configurations to minimize the mutual impact
