The trial on Florence’s tram line T1 demonstrated that the integration of the SYS-NGAP positioning system with 5G signal collection is feasible in real-world revenue service. The 5G-based positioning showed good accuracy, supporting real-time tram operations, while network throughput and latency confirmed suitability for operational tasks. Coverage and service continuity require improvement, mainly due to antenna placement and link fluctuations, highlighting the need for optimized network configurations. The trials confirmed that real-time tramway monitoring and obstacle detection are achievable with 5G-enabled systems. Future 6G deployments should focus on improving coverage, reliability, and dynamic resource allocation to support large-scale autonomous vehicle navigation and mission-critical transport services. Edge computing integration and AI-driven orchestration will be essential to maintain low latency and continuous operation across urban transportation networks.
