The sub-project’s trial in Iași showed that AI-based optimization improves multi-camera video analytics over 5G edge servers. Latency, network load, and energy use were significantly reduced, allowing more camera streams without overloading the system. The case underlines the importance of energy-efficient, scalable edge processing. 6G will need pervasive edge-cloud integration, dynamic resource orchestration, and ultra-low latency to manage large-scale urban monitoring effectively.
