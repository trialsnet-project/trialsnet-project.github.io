The sub-project showed validation in KPIs, mixed but acceptable results: while upstream bandwidth was lower than ideal, it met the needs of a metadata-focused application, and efficient bandwidth use and backend availability were measured. KVI results were positive, with over 90% of users rating the VR experience favourably, and 32% identifying VR as the ideal platform. The trial validated both technical performance and strong user engagement.
