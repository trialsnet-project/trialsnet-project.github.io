The trial of this sub-project demonstrated that integrating 5G connectivity with AI detection for milling chatter improves production quality and efficiency. Thirty participants observed real-time alerts, and network and application latencies stayed within acceptable limits. Downtime and material waste were reduced. This case emphasizes the need for low-latency, reliable links in industrial settings. 6G will require more robust industrial NPNs, real-time edge AI, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication for scalable, autonomous manufacturing.
