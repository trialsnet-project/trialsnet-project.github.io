Develop and assess an end-to-end use case in CNC machining that changes the current paradigm of human-based trial-and-error chattering supervision, towards a cloud-based and AI-enabled autonomous chattering control. The use case shall be able to a) measure and analyze reliably indicators related to the progress of the milling process, the machine state, and the workpiece conditions; and b) apply remote and instant decision-making that can guarantee operation compliant with the manufacturing standards.
