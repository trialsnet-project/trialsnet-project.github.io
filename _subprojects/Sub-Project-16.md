The primary objective of 5GVIREH was to define a secure and immersive platform for post-operative rehabilitation specifically designed for rotator cuff surgery recovery using VR headsets and 5G connectivity. The system enabled patients to perform prescribed rehabilitation exercises at home while healthcare providers offered real-time monitoring and guidance through secure VPN connections. A significant number of trials were executed from January 2025 at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico in Rome, involving 21 patients and 17 clinical operators across three distinct experimental sessions.
