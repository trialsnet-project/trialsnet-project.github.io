Extension of UC 13 to include the National Museum in Turin. 
The private 5G network that will be installed for the trial will be stressed by use of AR, VR with video
requiring high throughput and low latency. Moreover, the Museo host several models of past
Formula 1 cars, which will attract a passionate public which will ensure both high participation in the
trials and further exploitation of such innovative approach to other exhibition of the kind. The main
challenges are the following:
- Elevated Visitor Engagement: The incorporation of AR and VR elements promises to create a
more captivating and educational experience, fostering prolonged visitor engagement and
encouraging repeat visits.
- Rigorous 5G Network Stress Test: The demanding nature of AR and VR, within the museum
setting serves as a rigorous stress test for the TrialsNet 5G network, validating its capabilities under
high-throughput and low-latency requirements.
- Potential for Future Exhibitions: The success of this extended use case holds the potential to
reshape the role of private 5G networks in cultural institutions globally, paving the way for broader
adoption and technological integration in museum landscapes.
