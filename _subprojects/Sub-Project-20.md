The sub-project upgraded the OAI gNB to an Open RAN architecture and validated solutions to improve mmWave FR2 coverage. Trials showed high throughput in clear line-of-sight but strong degradation under blockage, mitigated through reflective surfaces and vision-aided proactive beam-switching. A web-based monitoring tool, positively rated by users (MOS 4.4/5), proved valuable for experimentation.
