The trial of this sub-project was performed across five EV stations in Athens and demonstrated that 5G-enabled AI analytics can effectively balance power loads and prevent grid disruptions. About 200 users interacted naturally with ten upgraded charging outlets, and real-time monitoring confirmed high responsiveness and reliability. Network upgrades reduced latency to around 50–70 ms and increased uplink/downlink throughput substantially, supporting over 500 charging sessions without major interruptions. These results underline the importance of low-latency, high-throughput connectivity and real-time AI processing for critical infrastructure. For 6G, sub-10 ms latency, ultra-reliable connections, and pervasive edge intelligence will be key to scaling AI-driven energy management in urban EV networks.
