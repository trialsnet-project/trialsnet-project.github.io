When synchronized, multiple charging sessions of electric vehicles (EVs) can multiply electrical loads in building complexes even leading to outages as the electrical installation is stressed beyond its designed capacity and circuit breakers trip. To address this, software solutions that are used to remotely monitor EV charging stations can also define load management rules. Under these load management rules, when multiple vehicles are charging in the same installation, charging capacity in each station is reduced so that the installation remains within its designed electrical capacity. However Charging Stations are connected to the web via wifi connection to the local router or to mobile connections via 4G. Such connections have latencies greater than 100 ms.The electrical installation of the building complex can still be compromised when multiple EVs initiate charging and the system has a delayed response due to high latency and high RTTs with the load management server. AI4RTC aims to improve load management responsiveness for EVCS by introducing 5G-enabled edge EV load management systems.
