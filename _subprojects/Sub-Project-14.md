MediVision-5G provided self-contained AR applications and 5G connectivity for surgical procedure assistance. It featured Connect-Note for AR-assisted remote communication and MediVision Information Console (MIC) for intraoperative 3D anatomical model visualization. The system leveraged WebRTC-based infrastructure and OpenVidu platform for secure, scalable, low-latency communication with CE-marked Class I medical device certification. Eight hospital trials were conducted across Italy and Spain at hospitals in Pisa, Turin, Arezzo, Ancona, Barcelona, and Madrid, utilizing both Wi-Fi and 5G networks.
