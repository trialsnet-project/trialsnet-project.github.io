METACLINIC demonstrated immersive, real-time remote healthcare services using 5G mmWave and VR technologies across two scenarios: remote emergency medical support over a 7.5 km mmWave link and remote consultations between İstanbul and İzmir (450 km apart). The Unity-based VR platform supported real-time audio/video communication via WebRTC and immersive interactions using Meta Quest 3 headsets. Six trials were conducted across multiple Turkcell sites, including İstanbul (Küçükyalı Plaza), İzmir Plaza, and Kınalıada island mmWave deployment.
