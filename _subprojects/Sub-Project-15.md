MediVision-5G provides a ready-to-deploy and transportable, preconfigured 5G network + edge computing
platform that requires seconds to be operational and zero knowledge from the operator. The system will also
be completely autonomous: it wonâ€™t require internet connectivity to operate. The edge platform will host an
AR application for medical use with several features to aid the surgeon during open and mixed surgery
operations.
