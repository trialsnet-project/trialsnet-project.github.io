title: Remote Coordination and Interworking of First Responders in Emergency Situations
---
This use case aims at enabling the remote coordination and interworking of different public agencies or first-responders by providing a complete 5G MCx solution, which will integrate a 5G-Advanced interworking function (IWF) designed to support the delivery of MCx over 5G and the interworking with legacy critical communication systems like PBX.

## Trial

Eviden successfully tests innovative mission critical communications over 5G for remote coordination of emergency teams. The tests were performed by Eviden in collaboration with the 5TONIC Laboratory and IMDEA Networks, with the support of the Madrid Fire Department (Bomberos de Madrid) on April 6, 2025.

The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that Eviden’s critical communications solution – Lifelink MCx Connect – makes it possible to remotely communicate and coordinate different first-responder groups, which until now have been working with different technologies and in isolation in emergency situations, optimizing their efficiency and response capacity.

The trial simulated a fire in the 5TONIC laboratory to test the intercommunication capabilities between different response teams. The IMDEA Networks janitorial group, equipped with PBX technology, made an emergency call to the fire department’s remote-control center, equipped with 5G MCx technology and a dispatcher application. The call was routed between the two technologies thanks to Eviden’s innovative MCx Connect Interworking Function (IWF). The control center immediately notified the fire station of the emergency via a group call. The firefighters entered the building, evacuated the affected personnel and extinguished the fire while in constant communication with both the control center and the IMDEA Networks first responders.

The trial demonstrated that the solution ensures the delivery of mission-critical services over 5G technology, enabling voice, data and video communications and facilitating interoperability with PBX networks in emergency situations. The implementation of the 5G-Advanced IWF in the 5G architecture allows different teams to coordinate through a dispatcher application that monitors the location and status of groups, manages profiles, facilitates group calls and enables remote coordination between different teams.

The entire communication infrastructure was provided by 5TONIC’s experimental 5G network, managed by Ericsson, and Eviden’s remote network infrastructure in Switzerland, ensuring ubiquitous coverage.
