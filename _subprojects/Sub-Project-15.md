This use case aims at enabling the remote coordination and interworking of different public agencies or first-responders by providing a complete 5G MCx solution, which will integrate a 5G-Advanced interworking function (IWF) designed to support the delivery of MCx over 5G and the interworking with legacy critical communication systems like PBX.
