adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (principle of ‘data minimisation’);
accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; we take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, erased or rectified without delay (principle of ‘accuracy’);
kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than it is necessary or as required by relevant Laws (principle of ‘storage limitation’);
processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical and organisational measures (principle of ‘integrity and confidentiality’).
Finally, we are able to demonstrate compliance with the aforementioned principles (principle of ‘accountability’).
