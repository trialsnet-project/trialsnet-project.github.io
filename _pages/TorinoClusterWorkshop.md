### Event Program, Key Themes and Demo Area

The event will take place in the afternoon, from 2:00 PM to 7:30 PM, and will be an opportunity to explore how emerging technologies are transforming cultural and tourist experiences. The key themes of the day will include a roundtable discussion on the results of the European TrialsNet project, which has funded innovative large-scale cultural use cases directly and specific trials developed by local companies with cascade funds. Another roundtable will feature the directors of important museums in Torino to discuss the application of these technologies, with a focus on the TrialsNet and CONVINCE projects. Additionally, the event will give space to some of the experiments by companies accelerated by CTE Next. Throughout the afternoon, a demo area will be set up where participants can experience first-hand the solutions presented by the companies.

### Torino - One City, Two Capitals

This event is yet another solid example of how Torino embodies its dual role as the European Capital of Innovation and the European Smart Tourism Capital. The event, also promoted through the social media channels of the European projects, CTE, and Torino City Lab, aims to consolidate Torino&#39;s leadership in the innovation landscape, serving as a model of collaborative governance among public bodies, businesses, and the cultural world.
