{: .text-justify} 
The grant awarded to the chosen applicants will not impact the ownership of any pre-existing intellectual property, including background technologies, designs, works, inventions, software, data, techniques, know-how, or materials.

The results of the trials should be freely used by the project for internal or external dissemination activity.

## Can we apply to other SNS project’s Open Call(s) at the same time as applying to TrialsNet Open Call?

Also note that in the case of three partners, the proposal would be submitted by one (1) Coordinating partner and the subgrant agreement would be with the Coordinating partner only and the payments will be made to the Coordinator partner, who will distribute payment to the other consortium member.

## Is it mandatory to request for a Feasibility Check of the proposal?
{: .text-justify}
