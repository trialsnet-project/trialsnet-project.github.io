# General FAQ

## Do we get a notification when an application submission is made?
Yes, you will get an email from the project.
## Do we get a notification about the results of the Open Call?
Yes, you will get an email from the project.
## How will we be paid by the project?
The payment is scheduled in three parts, subject to the level of development of the action, the submission of deliverables and the accomplishment of KPIs as reflected in the description of the trial:
-	20% of the assigned Grant after 1 month from the Grant signature against presentation of a detailed plan of activities
-	65% at competition of the contracted activities
-	15% when the EC will accept the projects final results

## What is the situation with IPR in the open call projects?
The grant awarded to the chosen applicants will not impact the ownership of any pre-existing intellectual property, including background technologies, designs, works, inventions, software, data, techniques, know-how, or materials. The third-party that contributes with TRIALSNET will retain ownership of their pre-existing  intellectual property.
The results of the trials should be freely used by the project for internal or external dissemination activity.
## What kinds of stakeholders can participate in the TRIALSNET open calls?
Applications to the Open Calls can be made by both private and public organisations from industry and research (not individual researchers), located within the EU Member States or Associated Countries. 
## Can an individual based in the European Union participate in an Open Call project?
No. In the project’s General Agreement and DoA, it is specified under grant eligibility, including definition of persons or categories that might receive financial support, as follows:
Any legal entity in Europe and Associated country.
## Can a group of collaborating partners that presents a proposal be composed by entities that are all located in a single eligible country?
Yes, they may be located in the same country.
## Typically, funding within Innovation action projects for-profit companies is 70%. Is this the case with funding for-profit companies participating in the open calls?
No. Private for-profit companies (whether big, medium, or small) can receive 100% of the funding. All contracted applicants will receive 100% of the presented costs, including 25% of overheads.
## Can we apply to other SNS project’s Open Call(s) at the same time as applying to TRIALSNET Open Call?
There is nothing to prohibit application to TRIALSNET at the same time as an application to another SNS projects Open Call; however, under no circumstances double funding is admissible for the same activity.
## Can more than one participant organisation team up to apply for a single project? How payments will be managed?
Yes, but only to a maximum of three partners, as follows: The target number of participants per proposal is one partner (Coordinator only) or maximum three partners (1 Coordinator and 2 Distinct partners). Also note that in the case of three partners, the proposal would be submitted by one (1) Coordinating partner and the subgrant agreement would be with the Coordinating partner only and the payments will be made to the Coordinator partner, who will distribute payment to the other consortium member.

## If we are involved in an Open Call application related to platform extensions (Option 2), what happens after the conclusion of the open call project?
The purpose of the platform extension projects is to extend the capabilities of the facilities on a continuous basis to its wider community of experimenters and application developers in evolved 5G platform for large-scale trials and pilots in Europe. Therefore, it would be mandatory that the Open Call projects are designed to provide ongoing support during the entire lifecycle of the TRIALSNET project. 
## Is it mandatory to get a feasibility check from an TRIALSNET test facility?
No. It is not mandatory.
## Will participant organisations be required to sign a Declaration of Honour (DoH)?
Yes. A Declaration of Honour will be requested to be signed once the final eligibility checks are made at the end of the evaluation period. All participant organisations in the project team should sign a DoH and return a signed copy to the designated TRIALSNET contact email. A template for the DoH is available on the Open Call website for you to examine.
