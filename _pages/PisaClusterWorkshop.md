## Details
Date & time: November 4th, 2025 – from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM CEST
Place: CNR – Pisa, Italy

The workshop "eHealth and Network Orchestrator in the TrialsNet Project: Use Case, Innovation, and Exploitation Prospects" will be held at the CNR in Pisa on November 4, 2025. The workshop's main objective is to explore the exploitation opportunities of the TrialsNet project, with the aim of understanding how the results obtained can be valorized even beyond the project's conclusion. Participants will include representatives from the telecommunications sector, both infrastructure providers and vendors, as well as universities, research centers, and healthcare professionals.

## Event Program and Key Themes

Two main aspects will be presented:
- **Applications** – Several biomedical use cases (such as remote surgical proctoring, smart ambulances, and intelligent prosthetic arm) have already demonstrated the benefits of 5G connectivity.
- **Network Evolution** – Emerging technologies, such as the Ericsson Orchestrator, mark an important step forward, enabling new applications and use cases.
Within this framework, the workshop will present additional biomedical applications and their end-user experience that have not yet been explored within TrialsNet, both in the mainstream activities and open calls.

The workshop is structured into three thematic sessions, each addressing a key area of innovation in eHealth and network technologies, and a panel.

- Session 1 introduces the clinical needs driving eHealth developments and presents TrialsNet use cases (UC7 and UC8).
- Session 2 focuses on the analysis of specific biomedical applications, such as advanced prosthetics (UC9), and includes presentations from open call projects.
- Session 3 shifts attention to the evolution of network technologies, examining the role of orchestration, vendor solutions, and business models supporting differentiated connectivity.

A panel concludes the event, involving representatives from industry, academia, and healthcare institutions, exploring lessons learned, exploitation strategies, and next steps for collaboration.
