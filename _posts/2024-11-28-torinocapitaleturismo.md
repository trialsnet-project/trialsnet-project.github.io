Torino was shortlisted alongside six other European cities, selected by the European Commission from a pool of 21 candidates across 10 countries. Along with the Piedmontese capital, the finalists included Genova, Bruxelles, Konya, Lahti, Lviv, and Porto.

The recognition is awarded annually to the European city that stands out as a leading tourist destination based on four key criteria: sustainability, accessibility, digitalization, cultural heritage, and creativity.

Regarding the digitalization criterion, emphasis has been placed on the city’s ability to act as a living lab for innovative solutions in urban environments, providing a real-world testing ground for the implementation of advanced technologies, also focused on culture and tourism. Research projects such as TrialsNet have certainly contributed to this effort, demonstrating how it is possible to guarantee efficient collaboration between public administration, private enterprises, and research institutions strengthening the tourism offer with innovative solutions. In particular, TrialsNet includes three Use Cases based in Turin, namely [UC5 - Control Room in Metaverse](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC5/), [UC12 - City Parks in Metaverse](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC12/), and [UC13 - Extended XR museum experience](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC13/), which cover different application areas, ranging from Security and Safety, to Culture, Tourism and Entertainment.
