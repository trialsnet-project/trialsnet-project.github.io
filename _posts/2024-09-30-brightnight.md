Last Friday, the annual appointment with the [European Night of Researchers](https://nottedeiricercatori.pisa.it/le-scuole-a-bright/) took place in Pisa, Italy.
TrialsNet was present at the "The future of Medicine: last generation sensors and connectivity for ealth" special event, together with the [TOLIFE](https://www.tolife-project.eu/) EU Project, to present our project to the event public.
The event was specially focused on solutions for telepresence for surgery, and CNR demoed UC7, showing how, in case of diseases such as COPD, data collected during daily activities can also be important and useful in predicting and mitigating exacerbations, continuously assessing the individual patient's health status to reduce complications, improve patients' quality of life and mitigate healthcare costs.
