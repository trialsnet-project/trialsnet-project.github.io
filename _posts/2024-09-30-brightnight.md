Last Friday, the annual appointment with the [European Night of Researchers](https://nottedeiricercatori.pisa.it/le-scuole-a-bright/) took place in Pisa, Italy. TrialsNet was present at the “The future of Medicine: last generation sensors and connectivity for ealth” special event, together with the [TOLIFE](https://www.tolife-project.eu/) EU Project, to present our project to the event public. CNR presented the project, with a special focus on UC7 “Remote Proctoring” and UC8 “Smart Ambulance” which aim to propose innovative solutions based on smart tools for telepresence in the surgical field. The goal is to connect expert physicians with remote hospitals to leverage remote expert support and enhance the entire e-Health workflow in interventional cardiology.
