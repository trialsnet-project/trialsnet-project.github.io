The 7th Plenary Meeting of the TrialsNet project took place from March 18 to 20, 2025, in Pisa, Italy. Hosted by the School of Advanced Studies Sant'Anna and the CNR Campus, this key gathering brought together consortium members to review progress, discuss ongoing trials, and align efforts to maximize the projectâ€™s impact.

In particular, TrialsNet partners discussed the status of the trials, how to maximize their visibility, exploitation, and impact, how to highlight their key innovations, how to better support the use cases from the Open Call, and the next steps to be taken.

Finally, there was also time for a hands-on with the solutions developed by the local partners: a live demo of UC7 was performed, and possible dissemination strategies for it were discussed.
