The day combined interactive and practical activities designed to foster engagement and dialogue. Participants attended a presentation about the Madrid cluster’s work within TrialsNet, and were introduced to the Design Thinking+ methodology and how it adapted to the specific project needs. This was integrated by two live demonstrations of key use cases:

- Smart Crowd Monitoring, presenting innovative solutions for the management and monitoring of large gatherings to improve safety and efficiency in public spaces.
- Immersive Fan Engagement, showcasing cutting-edge immersive technologies that elevate the spectator experience in sports and live events.

The agenda also included a guided visit to 5Tonic’s X3 laboratory, offering participants the chance to observe first-hand the millimetric wave connectivity infrastructure supporting next-generation network innovation.
