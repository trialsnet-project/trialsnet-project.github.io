During the last week of February 2025, the Milestone sub-project from the TrialsNet Open Call successfully completed its trial at Technopolis, City of Athens. The Milestone consortium partners (Plegma Labs and ExcID), with the help of TrialsNet partners DAEM and WINGS, demonstrated and evaluated the developed 5G-enabled public infrastructure monitoring system, which integrates deep neural network models, data spaces, Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC), and IoT device authentication in real-time.

The trial showcased the system's capabilities in terms of real-time communication between IoT monitoring devices, edge components, and cloud servers through the 5G network utilized. Participants were involved to provide feedback regarding multiple aspects, such as system usability, reliability, and resilience. Multiple Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Value Indicators (KVIs) were measured throughout the trial activities to evaluate the “Milestone” solution within a realistic public infrastructure environment.
