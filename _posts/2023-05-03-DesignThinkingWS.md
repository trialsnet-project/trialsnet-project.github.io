Starting on May the 3rd 2023, at the Casa delle Tecnologie emergenti di Torino - CTE NEXT, a series of design thinking workshops will be held to co-design Turin experiences, together with the project stakeholders and end-users.
Design thinking is a new approach to interactive brainstorming, combining creativity, empathy, and logic to find innovative solutions to problems, involving users. The first round will target under 25, representing heterogeneous profiles, as selected by the University of Turin and Politecnico of Turin.
Participants will define the requirements of the two use cases targetting cultural context in Turin: XR diffusive experience in museums, and Urban parks in the metaverse.
At the same time, police forces and other stakeholders will co-design the safety and security use caseÂ named Control Room in Metaverse.
