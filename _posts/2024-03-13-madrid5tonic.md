YBVR realized a 3D video to show the details of the 5TONIC facilities we are using for the lab testing of the use cases in the Madrid Cluster.
As the video is 3D, you can rotate the viewpoint and explore all the angles of the labs and facilities.

These facilities are also offered to the new use cases joining the project from the Open Call.
