All the use cases implemented by Orange Romania and the “Gheorghe Asachi” Technical University of Iași, with the support of Iași City Hall, have been triales. These included:
- Smart crowd monitoring – intelligent analysis of public space gatherings
- Smart traffic monitoring – real-time city traffic observation
