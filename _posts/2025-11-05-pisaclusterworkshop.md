## Key themes and highlights
The event focused on three main perspectives:
- **Biomedical Applications**: Several TrialsNet use cases, including **UC7**, **UC8**, and **UC9**, demonstrated practical implementations such as **remote surgical proctoring**, **smart ambulances**, and **intelligent prosthetic systems**, highlighting the tangible benefits of advanced connectivity in healthcare.
- **Network Evolution**: The **Ericsson Network Orchestrator** and related technological solutions were presented as enablers for new eHealth services, improved resource management, and innovative business models.
- **Innovation and Exploitation**: The workshop emphasized pathways for **technological innovation**, **research collaboration**, and **commercial exploitation** of the project’s outcomes.

Participants also had the opportunity to experience **live demonstrations** of the eHealth trials developed within the project, including the **Open Call sub-project COM05**, which further enriched the technological scope of the TrialsNet ecosystem.

## Thematic sessions and panel discussion
The day was structured into three main sessions and a final Panel Discussion:
-	**Session 1** – Clinical Needs and Use Cases (UC7, UC8): identification of key healthcare challenges and presentation of innovative eHealth trials.
-	**Session 2** – Biomedical Applications (UC9 and Open Call COM05): insights into advanced prosthetics and the extension of network-enabled healthcare solutions to new clinical fields.
-	**Session 3** – Network Evolution and Monetization: exploration of orchestration technologies, vendor perspectives, and business opportunities for differentiated connectivity.

The final **Panel Discussion** featured experts from **Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna**, **Regione Toscana**, **Boston Scientific**, **Ericsson**, and **TIM**, who discussed lessons learned, exploitation strategies, and opportunities for future collaboration across sectors. Within the TrialsNet framework, the **Pisa cluster** implemented three use cases involving multiple organizations and institutions.
