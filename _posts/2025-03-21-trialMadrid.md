On March 16th, 2025, the three Use Cases of the Madrid Cluster (i.e., UC1, UC6, and UC10) were trialed at the Movistar Arena, during a day with two basketball games, where more than 10.000 people gathered. This was possible thanks to the collaboration among ERC, PROS, TID, UC3M, YBVR, WINGS, and CERTH.

The Movistar Arena was transformed into a living innovation lab, where 5G SA technology was tested on millimetric waves (26GHz), shaping the future of large events thanks to large bandwidth, small latency, and flexible private network definition.

In particular, three Use Cases have been trialed:
- **Immersive Fan Engagement** with YBVR°: 360º video and VR allowed fans to enjoy the game from a new immersive perspective, as if they were in the first row or on the field, even if they were at home.
- **Smart Crowd Monitoring** with Prosegur Security: LiDAR sensors, robots, and smart cameras analyzed in real time the crowd flow, detecting anomalies and guaranteeing security.
- **Mass Casualty Incident** with UC3M, WINGS, and CERTH: using portable and wearable devices to improve the management in possible emergency situations, improving resource efficiency, and helping in case of evacuation.
