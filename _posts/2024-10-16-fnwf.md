This week, the IEEE conference on future networks took place in Dubai, UAE: Future Networks World Forum ([FNWF24](https://fnwf2024.ieee.org/)). The conference was dedicated to highlighting and showcasing the many exciting developments in 5G and Beyond technologies that are occurring in both industry and academia.
TrialsNet presented there a paper about the different Use Cases of WP3, describing the UCs themselves, the reference architecture over which they are implemented and will be trialed, and their current status and results, and their next steps.
The presented paper is titled "Trialing solutions for Security & Safety, Infrastructure, and Transportation, Supported By Smart Networks Beyond 5G", and is available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13944256)
