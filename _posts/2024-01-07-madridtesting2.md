Ericsson and Prosegur started a testing phase in the 5Tonic laboratories, in order to assess the efficiency of the 5G network for the connectivity of securement equipment, such as cameras, lidars and robots. The target use case was UC1 - Smart Crowd Monitoring.
During these demonstration, measurements were collected for the relevant KPIs to be analysed.

As a result of the testing, the team assessed that the communication in the closed network was successful, while it presented a significant delay when connecting to the Internet. Also, when all the equipment was connected simultaneously, the 5G network became saturated.

In future tests, higher transmission capacity and lower latency will be demonstraetd, thanks to the use of B5G technologies, allowing better communication and security quality.
