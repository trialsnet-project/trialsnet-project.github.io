Born from passion and inspired by the life of Alberto Ascari, the project pays tribute to the courage of drivers chasing the impossible, and demonstrates how immersive storytelling can create cultural value, transmit legacy, and connect audiences on a deep emotional level.

The artistic vision was brought to life by a team of extraordinary artists, technologists, and partners. From striking lithographic-inspired visuals to a spaghetti-western infused soundtrack, multiplayer MR/VR design, and authentic 3D recreations of historic racing moments, the project represents a fusion of technology, creativity, and cultural heritage.

This milestone is not only an honor for the team but also for the entire TrialsNet ecosystem, as it highlights the ability of immersive technologies to go beyond interactivity and serve as a living tribute to identity, risk, and the myth of motion.
