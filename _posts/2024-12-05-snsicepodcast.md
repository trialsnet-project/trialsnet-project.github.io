During the 5G Techritory conference, TrialsNet participated to the recording of a podcast organized by SNS ICE entitled “Lessons learned hosting vertical experiments from the perspective of 5G/6G experimental facilities”. The goal for this podcast was to gather ‘hands-on’ experts from each of the Phase 1 Stream D projects, to discuss their experience and insights and to participate in a panel with other experts, answering key questions on specific items such as the issues and obstacles in deploying vertical applications in 5G testbeds, the technological gaps between testbed providers and vertical developers that hinder deployment, the common services/tools to be provided to vertical experimenters for deployment and testing, and others.
