The strategic goal of TRIALSNET, during its conclusive phase, is to try and convert innovative trials into measurable commercial value. The recent public success in Turin with Use Case 13 (Culture, Tourism & Entertainment) serves as a relevant example of exploitation strategy.

On November 12th and December 10th 2025 (Pietro Micca Museum) and on November 13th and December 11th (Risorgimento Museum), the Extended Reality (XR) experiences, implemented and led by TIM, achieved notable public success, offering complete immersion in the underground tunnels of the Pietro Micca Museum and an interactive virtual game developed by TIM on the history of the Risorgimento.

This success validates crucial Key Value Indicators (KVIs), both at a social level (improving heritage accessibility ) and a commercial level (confirming high engagement and scalability). The modularity of the platform  ensures its readiness for rapid replication, leveraging Turin's recognition as the European Capital of Innovation and Smart Tourism 2025. This is how European Research and Development investment translates into scalable, market-ready service offerings.

We are now channelling these results for commercial adoption and as input for B5G standardization. We invite potential partners to explore how this validated platform can enrich the cultural heritage of your city.
