We are pleased to announce that TrialsNet has contributed to the recently published white paper, 6G KPIs – Definitions and Target Values, released by the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) Test Measurement and Validation Working Group (TMV WG). This document serves as a comprehensive reference for key performance indicators (KPIs) in 6G networks, consolidating insights from various SNS JU-funded projects. By defining and validating performance metrics, the white paper plays a crucial role in shaping the future of 6G technology and ensuring global alignment in network evaluation methodologies.

Our project actively participated in defining and refining several KPIs, providing valuable input on aspects. The methodologies and target values outlined in the paper were informed by research and trials conducted within TrialsNet, emphasizing our commitment to advancing next-generation communication networks. Through our contributions, we helped shape the framework that will be used for benchmarking and validating 6G technologies in upcoming research and standardization efforts.
