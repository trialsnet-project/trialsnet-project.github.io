The first trial of the TrialsNet project has been successfully conducted in Turin on 15th October 2024. In particular, the trial focused on the project’s Use Case 5 “Control Room in the Metaverse” which targets the enhancement of the safety and security forces’ operations through the development of a web-based application. A key feature of the UC5 is the creation of a collaborative Metaverse Control Room that can be accessed from any location using a security code using VR headsets and/or tablets. Inside the Metaverse Control Room the various officers can coordinate between them and receiving real-time information from the location of the accident. The use case also aims to evaluate the capability of the current deployment of the public 5G network in supporting this innovative application.

The trial saw the participation of eighteen officers from five security agencies in Turin, including 112 (emergency switchboard), 118 (ambulances), police, fire brigade, and civil protection.  During the trial, a simulated emergency situation in the Park of Valentino was enacted. This was preceded by an introduction and training session at the Talent Garden building nearby. Subsequently, participants reconvened at the Talent Garden to provide feedback through evaluation forms.

The trial was concluded successfully, meeting the expected Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Value Indicators (KVIs). On the KPIs side, the current deployment of the public 5G network effectively supported the trial setup consisting of one camera, one drone, two people counting sensors, and four portable devices. Nevertheless, it is likely that additional capacity will be required to handle larger incidents involving a higher number of equipment’s and portable devices. Concerning the KVIs, overall, the officers expressed positive feedback regarding the novelty and utility of the tool in streamlining interventions and enhancing communication among security forces. Valuable suggestions for further enhancing the application were also offered.
