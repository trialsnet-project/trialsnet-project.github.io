The feasibility check step of TrialsNet Open Call is closed and we finished processing and provided feedback to all the received proposals. 
This step was designed to provide applicants with the opportunity to share their intentions of contribution with the consortium, in order to verify the feasibility of the proposal and to receive informal and not binding feedback on it. 
We received and processed more than one hundred feasibility checks, describing new use cases of enhancements of TrialsNet use cases.
