Thanks to the collaboration between the project’s partner TIM and Municipality of Turin together with [CTE Next](https://ctenext.it/en/) (public-private partnership aimed at creating a technology transfer center in Turin), TrialsNet will be present at the MWC showcasing two demos related to the use cases implemented by the project.

The demo related to the [UC12 "City Parks In Metaverse"](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC12/) focuses on the most innovative technological aspect of the [successful trial performed in November 2024](https://trialsnet.eu/news/uc12trial/), based on the experimental XR Streaming platform developed by TIM. The visitor will be asked to challenge the entity of “Fosco”; the "fight" will take place in a Virtual Reality environment redesigned in real-time by a remote server based on the movements of the headset and controllers, and which will be experienced by the user through a high-definition and very immersive video stream.

Through the demo of the [UC13 “Extended XR Museum Experience” (Turin)](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC13/), visitors will be able to

1. take a Virtual Reality tour of the first Italian Parliament at the National Museum of the Risorgimento with the possibility of interacting with some historical elements, or
2. walk through the tunnels of the Pietro Micca Civic Museum, reliving the moments of the siege of Turin in 1706.

These demos have been developed by TIM on its commercial VR platform also supporting multi-user experiences. The demos will be accompanied by a brief technical introduction on the used technologies and solutions, also providing a vision of their possible evolutions from a 6G perspective.
