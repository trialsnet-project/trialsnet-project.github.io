## Transforming the Live Event Experience

Live events—whether concerts, sports matches, or festivals—are environments where connectivity is both critical and challenging. Thousands of people gather in a confined space, generating massive data traffic while demanding seamless communication. Traditional networks often struggle to balance safety, efficiency, and user experience under such conditions.

- **Real‑time crowd safety monitoring**, enabling organizers to track crowd dynamics, detect anomalies, and respond proactively to ensure public safety.
- **Immersive fan experiences**, where attendees can enjoy augmented and virtual reality applications that enrich their engagement with the event, from interactive replays to holographic overlays.

## Why 26 GHz Matters

Operating at **26 GHz**, TrialsNet’s testbed leverages millimeter‑wave spectrum to deliver ultra‑fast data rates and minimal latency. This frequency band is particularly well‑suited for dense environments like stadiums and arenas, where large numbers of users require simultaneous access to advanced services. The demonstration proves that B5G networks can support **fully wireless, large‑scale event infrastructures**, eliminating the need for cumbersome cabling and enabling flexible, scalable deployments.

## Key Highlights of the Achievement

- Deployment of **B5G connectivity at 26 GHz** in real-life event scenarios.
- Integration of **real‑time monitoring tools** to enhance crowd safety and situational awareness.
- Delivery of **immersive XR fan experiences** powered by ultra‑low latency links.
- Validation of a **fully wireless setup**, paving the way for safer, more engaging, and scalable event infrastructures.

## A Step Toward Safer, Smarter, and More Engaging Events

This achievement is more than a technical milestone—it sets the stage for the future of live events. By combining safety and entertainment into a single, network‑enabled framework, TrialsNet demonstrates how **Beyond‑5G technologies can redefine the way people experience large gatherings**. From ensuring public safety to creating unforgettable immersive experiences, the possibilities are vast.
