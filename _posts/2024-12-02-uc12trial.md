The UC12 trial was conducted on November 14 and 15 in Turin, and it went very well. About 120 teenagers, aged 16 to 18, from 6 classes of an art high school in Turin majoring in multimedia, plus 6 teachers and 15 people from the organizing staff. The participants also included people with reduced mobility, which were able to go all the way along with the other classmates.

The integration between TIM, CROSEU, and COTO worked very well (including with subcontractors LINKS Foundation, Tiny Bull Studio and IUSTO) and everything went smoothly in the 5 phases of the experience (AR park walk, VR combat, quiz on the historical cultural aspects of the visit, visit of the medieval fortress in 3D, KVI questionnaire filling). 
As for the KPIs, values where measured in both the park and the auditorium, and no problem was experiences with the 5G signal.

The team also analysed how the project can be enhanced in the future with a primarily edutainment purpose.
