The seminar showcased some of YBVR´s innovative immersive applications and facilitating design thinking activities for master’s students. The session provided a unique opportunity to introduce the TrialsNet Project and [Use Case 10 - Immersive fan engagement](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC10/) to the participants, paving the way for their involvement in the project's final trial in 2025.
