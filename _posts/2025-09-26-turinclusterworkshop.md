The Torino Easy to Visit: Innovation in Culture and Tourism event was successfully held on September 16, 2025, at CTE Next, an occasion that confirmed Torino's position as the European Capital of Innovation and European Smart Tourism Capital for 2025. The meeting offered a day of dialogue and experimentation, tangibly demonstrating how the city is leading the future of tourism and culture through the application of new technologies. The broad participation, with an attendance of about 70 people from institutions, cultural bodies, businesses, and citizens, underscored the interest and value of the initiative.

The event fully achieved its goal, going beyond a simple presentation of the core activities of the European TrialsNet and CONVINCE projects. A distinctive and valuable element was the ample space given to the experiments funded through TrialsNet Open Calls and to the museum verticals, which enriched the workshop with a wide range of technology demos. The day was an opportunity to discover the solutions developed within the European projects TrialsNet and CONVINCE, funded by the Horizon Europe program, as well as the initiatives promoted by CTE Next.

A special thanks was extended to Chiara Foglietta, Deputy Mayor in charge of Innovation of the City of Torino for opening the proceedings with her greetings and insights, and to the partners of the European TrialsNet project, TIM Enterprise and Crossmedia Europe, for their valuable contributions. An engaging roundtable featured Marco Mazzaglia, Andrea Basso, Giancarlo Caratti, and Carmen Criminisi, who discussed the TrialsNet project's experiments in Torino, focusing on the use of augmented and virtual reality in museums and at Valentino Park.
