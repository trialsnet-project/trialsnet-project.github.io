TrialsNet partners participated in the [5G Conference Southeastern Europe](https://www.5gconference.gr/index.php/en/), in Athens on September 26th 2023. In that context, some use cases were discussed, together with their criticalities and specificities. It was a great opportunity to make the point and compare to other solutions and use cases. It was also a perfect environment to monitor 5G development and deployment status, as well as to monitor the ecosystem evolution in Greece and SE Europe, and the opportunities it creates.
