As planned in our road towards extensive, on-field trial, this week, in the 5Tonic facility in Leganes, Use Case 6 ([UC6 - Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) and Emergency Rescue in Populated Area](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC6/)) and Use Case 10 ([UC10 - Immersive fan engagement](https://trialsnet.eu/usecases/UC6/)) have gone through a lab testing phase, in order to obtain preliminary KPI measurements and assess the behaviour in a controlled environment. The test included real users (students from UC3M University), allowing also to test the KVI assesment methodology.

The next steps will be (i) analysing the collected data and (ii) prepare for the on-field trial, including the identified needed adjustments.
