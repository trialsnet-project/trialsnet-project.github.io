Last week, Allbesmart, as integrant of the sub-project 6GVision from the Open Call, visited imec as part of their trial planning.

During their visit, Allbesmart did the setup of their OAIBOX O-RAN solution. They started by setting up a configuration of CU-DU. Using the N310, they demonstrated that the existing radio devices in imec's Next-G testbed could be used to set up a 5G small cell for research applications. Then, they changed the radio front end to Frequency Range 2 (FR2) using their X410 and the TMYTEK UD and BBox. Allbesmart has done some coverage tests in FR2 reaching around 10 meters still with very good throughput and latency values!
