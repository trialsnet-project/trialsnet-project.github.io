The effective management of public infrastructure is essential for the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of modern cities. TrialsNet UC2, led by WINGS ICT Solutions in Athens, introduces an AI-powered solution that leverages real-time data, advanced analytics, and B5G connectivity to enable proactive infrastructure maintenance. This innovative approach enhances efficiency, reduces costs, and strengthens the resilience of critical assets.

### Key Technologies Used

A remotely operated autonomous vehicle was used to scan roads, detect damages, and assess their severity. Equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors, the vehicle provided real-time visual and depth data, enabling detailed infrastructure analysis.

At the core of the solution is the WINGS Wi.MOVE platform, which utilises video analytics to:

- Identify infrastructure faults such as cracks and potholes 
- Estimate the severity of each damage for maintenance works scheduling 
- Recommend corrective interventions to optimize maintenance efforts

To ensure effective decision-making, all collected real-time data, camera feeds and the output of the analysis were displayed on the wi.MOVE interactive visualization dashboard. This provided a comprehensive overview of infrastructure conditions, helping operators monitor faults remotely, assess severity levels, and plan maintenance interventions more efficiently.
