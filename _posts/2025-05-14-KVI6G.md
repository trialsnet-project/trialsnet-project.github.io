We are pleased to announce that TrialsNet has actively contributed to the newly released white paper titled “6G KVIs – SNS Projects Initial Survey Results 2025”, developed by the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) Test, Measurement and Validation Working Group (TMV WG). This collaborative publication represents a significant milestone in shaping the understanding and evaluation of 6G’s societal, environmental, and economic impacts through the lens of Key Value Indicators (KVIs).

The white paper explores how KVIs can complement traditional technical KPIs, aiming to assess the broader implications of 6G technologies. It highlights the work and insights of numerous SNS JU projects — including TrialsNet — on the identification, classification, and preliminary measurement methodologies for a diverse set of 6G-related key values such as environmental sustainability, digital inclusion, personal health, and trust.

By contributing to this foundational document, TrialsNet reinforces its commitment to advancing not only technological innovation but also the societal relevance of next-generation networks. Our involvement focused on identifying applicable KVIs from real-world use cases and proposing practical approaches for impact evaluation, supporting the SNS JU’s broader mission to guide 6G development with strong alignment to societal values.
