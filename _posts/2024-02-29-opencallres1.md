The TrialsNet Open Call has closed, and it was a success! We received 158 proposals. One third of them aimed at option 1 and two thirds at option 2. 
58% of the applications come from single applicants, the rest from consortia. The vast majority of applicants have been SMEs. The detailed distribution of applicants by type is reported in the following figure.

The received applications covered all the three domains defined in our project, i.e., Infrastructure, Transportation, Security & Safety, eHealth & Emergency, and Culture, Tourism & Entertainment, being the first the most represented one (see details in the following figure).

Finally, the target location for the use cases proposed in the received applications are also fairly distributed among the project sites and other locations (option 2). See the detailed distribution in the following figure.

The following step is to conlude the feasibility check of the received proposals and to proceed with the contracting phase with the wining participants.
We wish good luck to all the applicants!
