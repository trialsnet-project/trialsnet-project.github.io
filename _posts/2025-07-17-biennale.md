After its successful [trial](https://trialsnet.eu/events/ascariMauto/), the sub-project [Black Cats & Chequered Flags](https://trialsnet.eu/subprojects/Sub-Project-23/), from TrialsNet Open Call, has been officially selected for the [82nd Venice International Film Festival](https://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2025) – La Biennale Cinema 2025.

Bringing Black Cats & Chequered Flags to La Biennale is both an incredible honor and an emotional milestone for the whole project. A solution to remember the past, and to pass on the weight of legacy, crafting something that goes beyond interactivity: a living tribute to identity, risk, and the myth of motion. Inspired by the life of Alberto Ascari, this immersive experience is a space where history, fate, and ambition collide.

The Biennale Cinema represents a natural home for a project leveraging the potential of immersive storytelling to connect generations through memory and immersive technology: something in line with the pure essence of Cinema. Furthermore, it represents a huge and privileged display window for the sub-project, and for the whole TrialsNet galaxy.
