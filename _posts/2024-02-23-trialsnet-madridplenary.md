TrialsNet partners met in the never-sleeping city of Madrid for the 4th plenary meeting of the project, on February 19-21, 2024. One of the main focuses of the meeting has been the wrap-up of the [Open Call](https://trialsnet.eu/open-call/) for proposal evaluation and selection, as well as the next steps organization for the onboarding of the selected proposals. As usual, the meeting represented also a great moment of focus, participation, teamwork, and proactiveness to progress on the activities related to the use cases implementation and trialing, addressing the transversal topics between the different work packages, and harmonizing their processes. Thanks to all the partners for the collaboration, especially to Prosegur, which organized the meeting and shared with the rest of the team their wonderful venue. See you in Turin in June 2024!!
