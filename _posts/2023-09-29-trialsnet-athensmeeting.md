TrialsNet partners met in the beautiful frame of Athens for the 3rd plenary meeting of the project, on September 27-29, 2023. One of the main focus points has been the finalization of the [Open Call](https://trialsnet.eu/open-call/) preparation, in order to consolidate the remaining open points and related details in time for the imminent launch on October 16, 2023. In addition to that, the meeting represented as usual a great moment of focus, participation, and proactiveness to progress on the activities related to the use cases implementation as well as to address the transversal topics between the different work packages. Thanks to all for the collaboration and see you in Madrid in February 2024!!
