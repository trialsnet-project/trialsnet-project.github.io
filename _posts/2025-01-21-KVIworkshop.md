As KVIs become further developed and integrated as key components of SNS JU projects, challenges have emerged around how to identify what is a good measure of a KV, and how these can look different for subjective and objective evaluations. Key to this is understanding how these approaches and instruments can be different from KPIs and what other methodological resources can be drawn upon in their development.

In this context, 6G4Society and TRIALSNET jointly organized a workshop on Objective and Subjective Approaches to Key Value Indicators. The aim of this workshop is twofold. First, it will share different approaches being developed in SNS JU projects as well as approaches used by external experts who also pursue indicators of social and sustainability values. Second, it will break the participants into small groups to work together to explore how what was presented can inform their diverse projects. The idea is to blend expert knowledge with interactive dialogues between SNS projects that are actively working on KVIs.
