On March 17th, 2025, the Eviden subproject "[Remote Coordination and Interworking of First Responders in Emergency Situations](https://trialsnet.eu/subprojects/Sub-Project-15/)", from TrialsNet Open Call, successfully completed its trial at the 5Tonic Labs.

The event represented a live demonstration to showcase their 5G MCx and Interworking Function. The trial counted on the participation of Bomberos Madrid and 5TONIC staff and proved how Eviden 5G MCx solution based on two MCx Client and MCx dispatcher applications and a novel Interworking Function can contribute to enhancing the delivery and coordination of mission-critical communications between different groups of first-responders using different technologies (5G and PBX) in emergency situations.

In the specific event trialed, the developed solution was used by Bomberos Madrid and 5TONIC caretaker team to evacuate and aid 5Tonic staff in the case of a simulated fire inside 5TONIC laboratory (Legan√©s, Madrid). The trial demonstrated an added value to Bomberos (firefighters) daily operative through the introduction of geolocation, video, and group call features, as well as by enabling the possibility to manage 5G and PBX communications from a single MCx dispatcher application located in a remote-control center. This last feature can be extremely important in emergency situations that require a coordinated response of different groups of first-responders (e.g. 2024 Valencia Floods).
