In first place, TrialsNet was present with a booth showcasing demos of different Use Cases. The booth was honoured by the visits of Pavlos Fournogerakis, Deputy Director of Programs of SNS JU, and of Colin Willcock, Chairman of the 6G-IA, and Alexandros Kaloxylo,s Executive Director 6G-IA, to whom the project's key achievements have been explained.

TrialsNet was also present through different workshops and special sessions, including:

- **Workshop 4 - Results and findings from SNS B5G large-scale trials and experimentations**. During the workshop, the main findings of the Stream-C and Stream-D SNS JU projects were discussed, focusing on the deployed network infrastructure and the lessons learnt from the interaction with the verticals during the use case trials. The workshop served to depict the cartography of the SNS-JU technology across Europe, including the clusters deployed by TrialsNet.

- **Workshop 16 - 6G experimentation methodologies, pitfalls and best practices**. During the workshop, the best practices and learnings on experimental methodologies from the active SNS JU projects were presented. As TrialsNet, we focused on methodological approaches for measuring Key Values (KVs), describing our framework that integrates both objective and subjective measurement instruments and emphasizes the importance of experimental design with proper comparative conditions.

- **Special Session 17 - Value Approach of 6G: The Role of Key Value Indicators in Design and Societal Impact**. The session focused on the current landscape of KVIs, elaborating on conceptual frameworks, mapping inter-dependencies, and outlining methodologies for prioritizing values across verticals and use cases. Different projects, including TrialsNet, addressed how KVIs can be integrated into technology research projects, discussing challenges in KVs assessment and possible solutions to integrating social values into 6G design and use.

In particular, TrialsNet contribution to the KV discussion was remarkable, as our experts contributed to the programme across multiple sessions focused on sustainability and societal impact in future connectivity systems: 
{: .text-justify}
- Paper presentation: “Sustainability and KVI assessment: An Approach for Key Value Indicator Evaluation – Enabling Consistent Assessment of Societal Impacts”. This paper explores a structured method for evaluating the societal implications of new technologies, helping ensure that value creation goes beyond economic gains.

- Special Session: SS17: Value Approach of 6G: The Role of Key Value Indicators in Design and Societal Impact:  Contributing to a panel discussion on “How to take KVIs forward”, bringing expert insight into how Key Value Indicators (KVIs) can be operationalised for meaningful impact across industry and society.
{: .text-justify}
- Workshop presentation: SS7: Social Acceptance as a Catalyst for Sustainable, 6G: Bridging Technology, Society, and Policy: Speaking on Social Acceptance as part of a special session dedicated to advancing the use of KVIs. The session explored the importance of aligning technological innovation with public expectations and values.

This contribution received great recognition for our Key Value Indicator (KVI) assessments — a robust framework for measuring social, economic, and environmental impact in connectivity projects. In particular, what sets our KVI work apart can be summarized as: 
{: .text-justify}
- Real-world validation – Trials with real users delivering actionable insights
- Practical frameworks – Methodologies partners can adopt immediately
- Built for evolution – Shaped by continuous stakeholder feedback since Day 1

TrialsNet's extensive participation at EuCNC & 6G Summit 2025 unequivocally demonstrated our leadership and dedication to advancing 6G technologies. From showcasing impactful use cases at our booth to driving critical discussions on experimentation methodologies, sustainable design, and, notably, our robust KVI framework, our presence was a resounding success. This engagement not only fostered valuable connections and affirmed our contributions to the SNS JU's vision but also solidified TrialsNet's pivotal role in bridging technological innovation with real-world value and societal acceptance for the future of connectivity.
